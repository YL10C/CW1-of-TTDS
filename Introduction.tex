\section{Introduction}
The goal of the project is to do the design and implementation of a simple IR tool based on an inverted index. The final system will support four search modes including Boolean Search, Phrase Search, Proximity Search, and Ranked Retrieval. The codebase involves the development of four major modules, namely document preprocessing (TextPreprocessor Class), creation of an efficient index structure (PositionalInvertedIndex Class), implementation of Boolean, phrase, and proximity search (QueryProcessor Class), and TF-IDF-based ranked retrieval (RankedRetrieval class). The implementation details for all modules are as discussed forthwith in the ensuing sections which also include the challenges faced and important lessons learned while solving the problem.

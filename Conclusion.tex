\section{Conclusion}

This whole assignment improves my study of information retrieval theory and problem-solving in practice. I deepened my understanding of how the search engines work. In the future, we can consider further optimizing and expanding the system. Such as increasing the types of search functions, fuzzy search, spell correction, etc. Besides, we can do query weighting in the ranked retrieval module and the combination of query weighting and document weighting may lead to higher relevance in the search result.
